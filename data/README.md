You will need this directory to save some final results of the experiments.

Raw Data Request Policy: We have cached and are safekeeping the vast majority of experimental data (with the exception of Figure 7, which was exported along with the experiment and not cached). We cannot upload it to GitHub due to its large overall size (>280GB), but you may request a limited amount of results for a specific experiment on a specific dataset/model. Please contact Hakaze Cho (yfzhao@jaist.ac.jp).

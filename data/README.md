You will need this directory to save the experiment results.

Raw Data Request Policy: We have cached and are safekeeping the vast majority of experimental data (with the exception of Figure 7, which was exported along with the experiment and not cached). Therefore, you may request any raw data or intermediate results from any experiment. Please contact Hakaze Cho (yfzhao@jaist.ac.jp).
